# Prime Context for Claude Code

Use the command `tree` to get an understanding of the project structure.

Start with reading the `CLAUDE.md` file if it exists to get an understanding of the project. Do not read the `CLAUDE.md` file in the other directories.

Read the `README.md` file to get an understanding of the project.

Read key files in the root directory.

IMPORTANT: Use Serena to search through the codebase. If you get any errors using Serena, retry with different Serena tools.

Explain back to me:
- Project structure
- Project purpose and goals
- Key files and their purposes
- Any important dependencies
- Any important configuration files
