I want to create a similar UI to what I currently have in Looker Studio for displaying table data — but make it interactive, intuitive, and more user-friendly.

You can check the existing Looker Studio dashboard here: https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/4/reporting/035910d5-7194-4d39-9e14-1a3232e53a6a/page/yV6AB

Goals:

Make the interface more engaging, modern, and visually appealing.

Ensure data is presented clearly and easy to understand.

Use Playwright MCP to capture the existing screen UI for better reference and inspiration.

You can use Plotly or native Streamlit APIs to build charts and visualizations.

Map the appropriate data tables intelligently to each visualization section on the front-end page.

Remove any existng UIs and replace them with the new UIs elements

Porperly execute test runs to ensure the UIs elements are properly designed and connected to the data tables. You can Unit test modules or  PlayWright for testings
